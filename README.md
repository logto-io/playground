# Logto Playground

ðŸ§ª Experimental stuff.

## Get Started

Create `.env` file with the following content:

```env
RAZZLE_OIDC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/oidc
```

Ensure your [logto core service](https://github.com/logto-io/logto) is up and listening on port 3001, then

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

Happy hacking on http://localhost:3000/ !
